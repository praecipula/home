My home project
---

I have some home automation that I'd like to be taken care of for me, including but not limited to:

1) A web interface to monitor home status (smart lights, etc...) and provide advanced functionality for monitoring their state
2) An automated system (with sidekiq) that runs cron-like jobs to pull data from web services (i.e. Google traffic, BART status) and update the website with the merged data.
3) A system for setting up reactive responses to external stimulus, i.e. when BART is late, set the lights to a color
4) Login-able with Google OAuth for a whitelist of people to access the data
5) To run on a Raspberry Pi
6) Perhaps provide camera or other remote sensing capability
7) Have multiple means of control, i.e. a direct connection or manipulation of (encrypted) files on Dropbox
8) Smarter functionality, i.e. lights on a schedule that are Gaussian-randomized, rather than consistent on/off
9) Provide person-monitoring; for instance, see if someone has turned the lights on externally (Laurie or Matt is home)
10) Provide monitoring and analytics, perhaps - i.e. web speeds
11) Family bookmarks for easy access to frequent links
12) Access control publishing of my own determination, i.e. putting the corporate menu in a (within this application) secure but public place
13) Heartbeat functionality to measure uptime of other house systems (does the router need a reboot?)
